This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house sale prices based on housing features. The purpose of this dataset is purely for ML purposes and this I have not performed any cleaning or EDA procedures. This dataset is from the kaggle housing data cometition(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/overview), to which I have made submissions using the presented code and data.
